Take-it-N-Go
============

The Take it n Go.. is the part of the sample application that provides customers with online shopping. Through a Web browser, a customer can browse the catalog, place items to purchase into a virtual shopping cart, create and sign in to a user account, and purchase the shopping cart contents by placing an order with a credit card. 
By integrating information and improving processes, emart  will help improve enterprise-wide decision support and operational efficiency. Improved efficiency translates into: 

+	More resources to support the enterprise . 
+	Improved customer service 
+	Web-based and more user friendly interfaces to buyers . 

An extremely powerful marketing tool,  emart’s ability to suggestively sell alternate and complementary products; e.g. if a customer selects the "standard" version of a product, you can recommend that they also consider the "pro" version or if your customer chooses a pair of pants, you can suggest that they also consider a belt and socks. Simply specify related product skus and optional text in a product’s definition in your Merchant Administrator, and PDG Shopping Cart will up-sell or recommend related products to your customers automatically.
